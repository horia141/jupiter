# Version 0.10.0

Launched on 2022/02/25

Like [version 0.9.0](version-0.9.0.md), this launch includes a numbr of big changes.
They have to do with UX this time and how one interacts with Thrive via Notion.

This version introduces:

* A unified inbox, recurring tasks, and big plans. These were previously separated by
  project, which meant there were actually multiple inboxes you needed to pay attention to.
  Not anymore. Projects have been transformed into an organising label.
* Separation of recurring tasks into [habits](../concepts/habits.md) and [chores](../concepts/chores.md),
  each with their own behaviours. Habits can be repeated, while chores can be suspended during vacations, and
  have activation intervals.
* Icons! Things look a bit prettier now!
* Many bugfixes and stability improvements.

# Working Mem

Thrive has a feature for
[workingmem.txt](https://calnewport.com/
deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of/) files.

These are notes you can write into during a day or week, with little structure.
Periodically you clean them up and integrate into your planning.

These get archived after 2 weeks.

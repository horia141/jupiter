# Stats

Thrive gathers _statistics_ around the work that you're doing
in many ways: big plan progress, habits streaks, journal-level
general activities, time plan efficiency, gamification scores, etc.

These are both another, more quantiative way of looking at the
work that youre doing, and a tool to help you plan better for
the future.

Many of these statistics are computed in an online fashion
as you're using Thrive. There is a periodic process that
computes these across the board, for cases where it's impractical
and for situatins where errors or bugs mean computation
didn't happen correctly.

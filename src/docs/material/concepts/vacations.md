# Vacations

A _vacation_ is a set period of time when some scheduled tasks aren't scheduled. These are
essentially chores that do not have the _must do_ attribute set.

Vacations are attached to the workspace. You can see the vacations in
the `Vacations` left-hand menu tab. An example:

Alternatively you can see vacations via `vacation-show` in the CLI.

# Thrive

## About

Thrive is a tool for _life planning_. It provides goals management, task tracking, work planning,
habit building, a journal, chores management, lists, metrics, a personal relationship manager, and
much more. All in a unified package.

I built it to [solve an issue I had](http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html) - making sure everything
I wanted to get done actually got done, while juggling the standard complexities of life - family, kids, career, etc.

Inspiration comes from [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/),
[The Deep Life Stack](https://www.thedeeplife.com/podcasts/episodes/ep-252-the-deep-life-stack/),
existentialist philosophy, [Notion](https://notion.so), Todoist, and many others.

The current version is both a [webapp](https://get-thriving.com), a desktop app,
 a mobile app, a PWA, and a [CLI application](how-tos/install.md). You can even [self-host](how-tos/self-hosting.md) it.

 Checkout the full list of [features](features.md), but here's a sneak peek at
 what it can do.
 
 Here's a picture from the "inbox" view:

And a metric feature:

And finally, a timeplan feature:

# Version 0.7.0

Launched on 2021/02/13

This version introduces:

* Metrics support. There's now basic support for handling metrics.
* Notion fields for inbox tasks, big plans, etc. are now in a stable order, and many of the "technical"
  ones are hidden. It leads to nicer UX for working with these entities.
* Big refactorings in the codebase. Nothing user-visible but these changes allow major work in the
  future.
* Numerous bugfixes and small improvements.

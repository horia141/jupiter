# Roadmap

Thrive is now at `v1.1.x`. This means it has some notion of stability and is also shareable and usable by
folks besides me - its creator. Nevertheless, it is a labour of love and a side-project. It has some way
to go before doing all the things I'd like it to. This doc is a rough roadmap. But there's _no commitment_ to
dates or order of delivery.

# Local Vs Hosted Mode

You can use Jupiter in two primary ways - _hosted_ or _local_.

_Hosted mode_ is what you get when you go to [the webapp](https://jupiter-webui.onrender.com/).
The Jupiter company is hosting a central install of the Jupiter software, and manages all the
user accounts, infrastructure, data, etc. to make this happen. Your workspace is in the
_cloud_. Since it's on the web, you can access it from everywhere, and every one of your
devices. This is the simplest and most convenient way to use Jupiter.

_Local mode_ is what you get when you [download](../how-tos/install.md) the CLI app and run it on your
own computer. Your workspace lives on your machine, and is not accessible from anywhere else.
Nobody else has access to your data, and you can take control of infrastructure needs yourself.
This is an advanced/niche way of using Jupiter, but I'm committed to making this thing work
well too.

# Journals

A journal is a brief recounting of how a particular day, week, month, or other time period went. Journals live in the "journals" view.

## Journals

Journals are written on a particular _day_ for a particular _period interval_. The period can be one of:

* _Daily_: the day's journal
* _Weekly_: the week's journal, as recorded on the particular _day_.
* _Monthly_: the month's journal, as recorded on the particular _day_.
* _Quarterly_: the quarter's journal, as recorded on the particular _day_.
* _Yearly_: a whole year's journal, as recorded on the particular _day_.

Only one journal can exist for a particular _day_. Furthermore, a 
single journal can exist for a particular _period_ in time (so you
better write the journal of that period towards the end of it).

Journals are mainly a written artifact, so they're essentially one big document. But they do have a recording ot the work activity 
that happened during that period (scores achieved, tasks done, etc),
much like in the [report functionality](reporting.md).

## Interaction

# Tutorial

## Access

First, go to the [Thrive](https://jupiter-webui.onrender.com). This is the _hosted_ version
of Thrive, which is the recommended way to start. If you're looking for a _local_ install,
then checkout [installation instructions](how-tos/install.md). Everything below should work the same.

## Create A Workspace

The _workspace_ is where all your work in Thrive happens. You'll first need to create one.

On accessing Thrive you should just see a basic button which you _need to click_.

You'll see a login form. You need to press `New Workspace` and you'll be prompted with the following:

![Init](assets/tutorial-init.png)

You can check what the advanced and [feature flags](concepts/feature-flags.md)
accordions to, but equally you can ignore them.

Press `Create` and you will be shown an [account recovery token](how-tos/recover-your-account.md) that
you need to store in a safe space. Once you do that, you can proceed to _your newly created workspace_.

This will be empty and minimalistic from a features point of view:

## Create An Inbox Task

Let's create an inbox task. Press `Create` and you'll be prompted with something like this:

![New Inbox Task](assets/tutorial-new-inbox-task.png)

Name the task `My fist task` and press `Create`. Things should look like this now:

Switch over to the `Kanban By Eisen` view and drag and drop the task to the `Done` column. Things should
look like this now:

of this guide to get yourself familiarized with the possibilities. Checkout [concepts](concepts/overview.md)

# The Jupiter Goal Management System ![Develop](https://github.com/horia141/jupiter/workflows/Develop/badge.svg) ![Release](https://github.com/horia141/jupiter/workflows/Release/badge.svg) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupiter-goals/badge/?version=stable)](https://jupiter-goals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable) [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Jupiter is a tool for _life planning_. It provides goals management, task tracking,
habit building, chores management, lists, metrics, a personal relationship manager, and
much more all in a unified package.

I built it to [solve an issue I had](http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html) - making sure everything
I wanted to get done actually got done, while juggling the standard complexities of life - family, kids, career, etc.

The current version is both a [webapp](https://jupiter-webui.onrender.com/) and a
CLI application.

Here's a picture from the "inbox" view:

And here's one for the "big plans timeline" view:

get a feeling for what the application can fully do!
